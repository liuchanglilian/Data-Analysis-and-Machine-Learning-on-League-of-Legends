# Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-on-League-of-Legends
Based on selected world tournament match records dataset, this project aims to make analysis about region gaming styles, strategies, and the win rates behind it in the game of League of Legends. This project made a logic regression to analyze the effect of different parameter on the match result and used Log5 formula to find the win rate between each two champions. Furthermore, from these match records, with various champions selected by different players to content, a model was trained to predict match result based on champion selection. With the analysis in this project we answered how to pick champions according to the champion picked on the other side.
